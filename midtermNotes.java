/*
object-oriented: java, python
JVM:java virtual machine
	-compiler 
OS: operating system
	-basically ok to compile with our windows, mac, linux, etc.
IDE: Integrated development environment
	-e.g. eclipse, visual studio, inteliJ

Java:
	-James Gosling, 1995
		-python created after

Java has classes (.java)
	-location: eclipse workspace

String, Primitive Data Types
	-int, double, float, long, short, byte, boolean, char
		-how many bytes r each one? (not on exam just good to know)
		-which ones r biggest to smallest
	-String is not primitive!
	-character '', string ""
	
Public static void main(string[]avg){
	- public or private
	- static = ??? :)
	-main = name of method
	-void = what is returns (void means nothing),
	if it returns something make sure you have return
	statement in the method.
	-it doesn't matter what order you put your methods in
	-make sure ur method isnt inside of another method
	
if else statements and all syntax
	-conditions tests, 1 test, 2 test, 3 test, etc.
	
If given a nested loop, need to figure out results.
***Know for loop syntax ***
and also while loop, do while loop
	
println/print + concatination: 
	-things like n/ in strings, escape sequences, etc. (in textbook ch. 1 i think)

know the imports we've used
	-scanner, random, LinkedList, array

collections framework:
everything about:
	-arrays
	-linkedlist
	-can they grow dynamically or not?
	-indexing
-IO exceptions 

File reader and writer
	-accessibility to files external to the ide e.g. .doc, .cov. .xlsx, .pdf,etc text files.
	 (not .mp4/.wav, etc.)

example something on the test:
	-blank linkedlist
	-hmm what is code doing?
		-things r added and removed
	-find out what is printed at end
	-if in loop, how many times will print out?
	-be careful of things like order of the things being called,
	it might cause an error
	
pseudo code
if an array is created w/o anything inside of it, they r all "null"
also the index starts at 0 btw dont forget
if there is no e.g. 17 place in array  = "out of bounds"

+random questions from the book we didnt talk about in class
